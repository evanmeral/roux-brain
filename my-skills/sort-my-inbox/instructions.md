# Sort My Inbox

## Goal
Clear the mental load of an unread inbox. Read the new mail, sort it into what needs the owner and what does not, and draft a reply for everything waiting on an answer. The owner reads one summary instead of forty emails.

Replies are drafted by default. They are sent only if the owner says so and their email connector allows sending.

## Inputs
- Email connected (Gmail or Outlook). If it is not, say: "I need your email connected for this one. Type /connect and I will walk you through it."
- Optional: a limit ("just today's emails", "last 20").
- If both Gmail and Outlook are connected, ask which inbox to go through, or offer to do both.

**Gmail and Outlook both save drafts into the mailbox.** One Outlook wrinkle: drafts only land once the owner's Microsoft 365 admin has approved the connector's permissions (a one-off; for most small businesses the owner is the admin). If saving a draft fails on permissions, show the reply in chat to paste, or, if Claude in Chrome is installed, offer to type it straight into Outlook on the web, and mention that the one-off approval fixes it. Reading and sorting work the same on both. Sending happens on either only when the owner asks and the connector allows it.

## Steps

### Step 1: Read the new mail
Pull unread emails from the inbox. Default to the last 2 days if the user did not say. If there are more than 30, do the most recent 30 and say so in the summary. Never silently skip mail.

If the inbox cannot be read (connection broken, sign-in expired), STOP and say so plainly: "I cannot read your inbox right now, so nothing has been checked. Type /connect to fix the connection." Never present a failed read as an empty inbox.

### Step 2: Sort each email into one of three piles

- **Waiting on you.** A real person needs an answer. A customer enquiry, a question, someone trying to book, a supplier waiting on a decision.
- **Worth a look.** No reply needed but the owner should see it. An invoice received, a notification that matters, an FYI from a real person.
- **Noise.** Newsletters, receipts, marketing, automated notifications. Safe to ignore.

One rule when unsure: if it could be a real person waiting on a reply, it goes in "Waiting on you". A wasted draft costs nothing. A customer left hanging costs real money.

### Step 3: Draft replies for the "Waiting on you" pile
For each one:

1. Read what they actually asked.
2. Pull what you need to answer properly: `my-business (context)/my-voice.md` for how the owner writes (fall back to `how-we-sound.md` if the voice profile is not built yet), `what-we-sell.md` for pricing and services, `our-clients.md` if they are a known client, the calendar if they asked about availability.
   Then match the relationship: search the sent folder for 3-5 past emails the owner wrote to this same person and mirror that register. The owner writes to a long-time client differently than to a stranger, and their own history shows exactly how. No history: use the voice profile's examples.
3. If you can do the legwork the email asks for, do it before drafting. Someone asks for a time: check the calendar and offer a real one. Someone asks for a price: put the real price in. The draft should read like the work is already done, not "I'll get back to you".
4. Draft the reply in the owner's voice. Before saving or showing it, check it against the never-rules in my-voice.md and how-we-sound.md (sign-offs they never use, phrases they hate); if it breaks one, rewrite it once. Then save it to their drafts folder (Gmail or Outlook). If Outlook refuses on permissions, show the draft in chat to paste, or offer to type it into Outlook on the web via Claude in Chrome if that is installed.
5. If an email needs a decision only the owner can make (a discount, a complaint, a contract), do not guess. Put it in the summary as a question with the facts laid out.

### Step 4: Deliver one summary

**Your inbox: X new emails**

**Waiting on you (X)** - for each: who, what they want, and "draft ready in your drafts folder" or "draft below" (only if Outlook could not save it, paste it in) or "needs your call: [the question]".

**Worth a look (X)** - one line each.

**Noise (X)** - just the count, plus "want me to list them?"

Every email read lands in exactly one of the three. None disappear.

## Output format
One summary in chat. Drafts saved to the drafts folder (Gmail or Outlook), or shown in chat to paste if Outlook could not save them yet.

## Quality check
- Nothing was sent unless the owner asked for it.
- Every email is in the summary. Nothing silently dropped.
- Drafts answer the actual question and sound like the owner.
- A broken connection was reported as broken, never as "inbox clear".
